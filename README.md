## These are terms that are used within project development

### Scrumdown Terms
1. Burn-Down Chart

A chart that shows the amount of work that remains. Time is represented on the x-axis and the amount of work on the y-axis. The chart is a means to communicate unfinished work from either sprint or product backlogs.

2. Sprint

An event that usually consists of 30 days or less, with work being carried out consecutively and without gaps.

3. Stakeholder

A peron with interest within the project and actively engaged with the scrum team.
  
4. Velocity

An optional, but often used, indication of the average amount of Product Backlog turned into an Increment of product during a Sprint by a Scrum Team, tracked by the Development Team for use within the Scrum Team.

5. Product Backlog

An ordered list of the work to be done in order to create, maintain and sustain a product. Managed by the Product Owner.
  
6. Development Team

The role within a Scrum Team accountable for managing, organizing and doing all development work.
  
7. Increment

Piece of working software that adds to previously created Increments, where the sum of all Increments -as a whole - form a product.
  
8. Forecast

Items from the product backlog deemed feasible for implementation by the development team.
  
9. Sprint Planning

### Programming Terms
1. Algorithm

A process followed in caluclations or other solutions, run mainly by a computer.

2. Paradigms
* Procedural - This paradigm is based on the concept of procedures or methods; sequences of commands to be executed. Procedures are mainly used in largeer projects, used by many programming languages and have the following benefits:
  - Reusability of code designed as procedures
  - Ease of following the logic
  - Maintainability
* Object Oriented - This paradigm is based on objects that contain data in fields, rather than actions and logic. Both functions and data make up an object and can be inherited from other objects the programmer creates.
* Event Driven - This paradigm allows for the program to react towards user input. Specific inputs such as clicking on a button or typing in text and used for different functions to operate.
