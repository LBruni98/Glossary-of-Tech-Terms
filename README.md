# Glossary-of-Tech-Terms

## These are terms that are used within project development

### Scrumdown Terms
1. Burn-Down Chart

A chart that shows the amount of work that remains. Time is represented on the x-axis and the amount of work on the y-axis. The chart is a means to communicate unfinished work from either sprint or product backlogs.

2. Sprint

An event that usually consists of 30 days or less, with work being carried out consecutively and without gaps.

3. Stakeholder

A peron with interest within the project and actively engaged with the scrum team.
  
4. Velocity

An optional, but often used, indication of the average amount of Product Backlog turned into an Increment of product during a Sprint by a Scrum Team, tracked by the Development Team for use within the Scrum Team.

5. Product Backlog

An ordered list of the work to be done in order to create, maintain and sustain a product. Managed by the Product Owner.
  
6. Development Team

The role within a Scrum Team accountable for managing, organizing and doing all development work.
  
7. Increment

Piece of working software that adds to previously created Increments, where the sum of all Increments -as a whole - form a product.
  
8. Forecast

Items from the product backlog deemed feasible for implementation by the development team.
  
9. Sprint Planning

Time-boxed event of 8 hours, or less, to start a Sprint. It serves for the Scrum Team to inspect the work from the Product Backlog thatâ€™s most valuable to be done next and design that work into Sprint backlog.
  
10. Sprint Review

An event after the sprint that takes around 4 hours or less to conclude the work in a sprint and to inspect the product of a sprint.

### Programming Terms
1. Algorithm

A process followed in caluclations or other solutions, run mainly by a computer.

2. Paradigms
* Procedural - This paradigm is based on the concept of procedures or methods; sequences of commands to be executed. Procedures are mainly used in largeer projects, used by many programming languages and have the following benefits:
  - Reusability of code designed as procedures
  - Ease of following the logic
  - Maintainability
* Object Oriented - This paradigm is based on objects that contain data in fields, rather than actions and logic. Both functions and data make up an object and can be inherited from other objects the programmer creates.
* Event Driven - This paradigm allows for the program to react towards user input. Specific inputs such as clicking on a button or typing in text and used for different functions to operate.

#### Coding Standards
Coding Standards are a set of guidelines for a developer to follow in order to create high quality code. These guidelines help a developer write in a specific way that best suits that language. It works because developers would have written in their own style when others would write their code in a different style; different indentation, naming of functions and commenting. If in a workplace environment, setting a standard for coders would help, so to improve readability of the code and helps with editing and modifying.

#### IDE
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is an application that provides a user with tools for writing up and testing software.

##### Analysis
A common feature that an IDE has is something called syntax highlighting. What this does is that it provides a colour scheme to support readibility and writing of the code, to differentiate the categories in a programming language that the IDE supports, with colours for variables, conditional statements, strings, comments, etc.



##### Use Against the Development of apps not using an IDE
#### Debugging Process and Debugging Facilities
Debugging is a very useful tool when it comes to finalizing a program and making it both stable and accessible to the public. Debugging works by reading through the lines of code and from error codes delivered to the IDE's console, the developer can use these codes to generally see where the mistakes and problems are. IDE's can offer limited to advanced debuggers with a handful of tools, but most often than not, they would result to an actual debugger, different to an IDE as the tools can assist in tracking variables and breaking down code.

For programs, this means that the initial program can be mended quicker rather than looking at every individual line of code or just relying solely on error codes. This may be fine for smaller projects but debugging can help with larger projects, even for complex programs.

The debugging process begins when the code the user writes is completed and is continued in stages, being combined with other pieces of code and the product coming together. Errors are detected once the code is run through a computer program, mainly an IDE and once it has been identified, then it is necessary to track down the error in the code. Looking at a logger mainly is a good way of finding the code and using either a standalone debugger or the IDE's built in debugger to track when and where the bug strikes and use said debugger to assist in fixing the bug. The bugs are fixed along with assessing that no newer bugs have appeared.
